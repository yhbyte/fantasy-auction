# üêâ Dragon‚Äôs Den of Deals

**Fantasy auction platform for digital products & services**  
This project aims to create an online auction platform where users can list and bid on "magical items". In reality,
these items represent digital products or services like PDFs, templates, mentorship sessions, small freelance tasks,
etc. The goal is to build a functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP) within the 100-day timeframe.
